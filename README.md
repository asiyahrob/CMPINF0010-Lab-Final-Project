**Abstract:** In order to determine the best Pittsburgh neighborhood, our group **Parks and Recreaction** decided that the best neighborhood would definitely be the most fun for both adults and children. Therefore, we decided to design a metric called *fun_level*, the higher the fun level the more happy the population. Consequently, we decided that the best neighborhood is the one with the happiest people. This metric is constituted by the amount of public art pieces and playgrounds in each neighborhood. We chose Public Art for the adult population and Playgrounds for the child population. We chose these date set because they would make people feel happier in general and more connected to their neighborhood.
